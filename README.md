# Gaussian Process regression and RBF interpolation

Gaussian process and RBF interpolation implemented in `Python`.

## Gaussian Process regression

Given a random set of samples `x`, and their respective values `y`, which arise from some function `f(x)`, we can construct a kernel and predict for values of `x` not present in the input. When trying to predict values for `x` with gaussian a kernel needs to be constructed with great care, often a mix of different kernel functions gives the best performance.

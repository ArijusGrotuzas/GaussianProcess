# Gaussian Process regression and RBF interpolation

Gaussian process and RBF interpolation implemented in `Python`. Based on C. M. Bishop's book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (2006).

## Gaussian Process regression

Given a random set of samples `x`, and their respective values `y`, which arise from some function `f(x)`, we can construct a kernel and predict for values of `x` not present in the input. When trying to predict values for `x` with gaussian process the kernel needs to be constructed with great care, often a mix of different kernel functions gives the best performance.
